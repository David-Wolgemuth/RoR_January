# RoR_January

When uploading a file...

- search for the appropriate folder
    - (ex: ./Ruby/OOP/MathDojo)
- create folders as necessary
- make directory for your name
    - (./Ruby/OOP/MathDojo/David_W)
- place all files for project in directory
- git commit, git push

Rules

- try not to duplicate folders
    - (ex: ./Ruby/Intro and ./Ruby/Introduction -- use whichever was first made)
- don't look ahead
    - this repo is meant for comparing/contrasting your work.  In cheating, you only cheat yourself
- upload everything!
    - err on the side of uploading too much
    - if you're wondering if it should be uploaded, upload it.
- look at each other's work, make comments on each other's commits, use this great opportunity to collaborate!
