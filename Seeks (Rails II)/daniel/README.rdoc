Accessing a Rails Server running on VBox guest.

Go to VirtualBox... Settings -> Network -> Port Fowarding
Enter 3000 for Host Port
Enter 3000 for Guest Port
Go to your VirtualBox guest machine.
In the terminal run ifconfig, to check the eth0 IP (10.0.2.15)
When you run the rails server, in the VirtualBox guest machine, use the following command:
$ rails server -b 10.0.2.15
You want to bind to that address.
On your Host System, go to the browser and visit http://127.0.0.1:3000
